# DIGIGIRL-SQL-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
This SQL project involves querying a database to extract insights from customer transactions, payments, and addresses. 
---
# Project Objectives: 
To analyze customer data and transactions using SQL queries to uncover insights such as customer behavior, payment trends, and address-sharing patterns.

---
# Data Sourcing: 
The data is sourced from a relational database containing tables related to customers, payments, and addresses.

---
# Tools Used:

**SQL** for querying and analyzing the database
**Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** for data storage

# Data Transformation: 
1. Joined multiple tables to extract meaningful insights
2. Aggregated payment data to identify the highest-paying customers
3. Filtered and grouped customer information to detect patterns in shared addresses


---
# Major Highlights of the Visuals:
•  Identified whether customers share the same address
•  Found the customer with the **highest total payments**
•  Extracted **key transaction trends** from payment data

# Conclusion:

The SQL queries provided valuable insights into customer behavior and payment patterns, helping businesses understand customer trends and optimize services accordingly.
